# GET 2 EMPTY LISTS
# START A WHILE LOOP
# GIVE A FOR LOOP TO PRINT THE TODO LIST with sorting like 1...2..3...(use f string)
# PRINT A FEW STATEMENTS TO THE USER LIKE * OR ENTER A COMMAND
# ASK FOR A COMMAND
# GIVE SOME CONDIIONALS LIKE IF Q THEN BREAK AND IF H ITS GIVES INFO ABT THE STUFF
# IF ITS NUMBER THEN IT REMOVES THAT INDEX FROM THE TODO LIST AND ADDS IT IN A ANOTHER VARIABLE WHICH WE APPEND TO THE LAST COMPLETED LIST
# IF ITS NOT A NUMBER THEN IT APPENDS THE COMMAND TO THE TODO LIST
# AFTER THE WHILE LOOP ENDS, PRINT THE COMPLETED LIST IF IT HAS ANYTHING IN IT
# AND PRINT THE TODO LIST IF IT HAS ANYTHING IN IT
